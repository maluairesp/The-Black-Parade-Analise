    "description_preview": "The Black Parade is the third album by American pop punk band My Chemical Romance. The concept album follows the fictional character \u201cThe Patient\u201d through the end of his life and his death.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the Black Parade,\u201d \u201cFamous Last Words,\u201d \u201cI Don\u2019t Love You,\u201d and \u201cTeenagers\u201d were released as singles, each earning a music video.\n\nThe album received a generally positive reception, being called \u201ca rock and roll gem\u201d by Ed Thompson of IGN, and \u201cone of the most cohesive, engaging rock records of 2006\u201d by Entertainment Weekly.\n\nThe album debuted at #2 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and the U.K. Albums Chart. Over three million copies have been sold worldwide.\n\nGuitarist Ray Toro told Alternative Press:\n\nThe intention was to make something that was classic, something timeless [\u2026] we wanted to make a record you could pass down.\"\n\nThe concept behind the album seems to be a polysemous story, built upon at least two parallel paths.\nThe Patient\u2019s journey through the disease and imminent death AND the band\u2019s personal struggles (mostly lead singer Gerard\u2019s).\n\nIt is no coincidence that all the songs are featured by seemingly disconnected verses which lack the typical continuity of a plot.\nDespite being deliberately ambiguous, the almost inconclusive and delusional narration reflects the personality of The Patient that, finding himself face to face with death, is overwhelmed by conflicting emotions.\n\nThe striking example can be seen in \u201cWelcome to the Black Parade\u201d, where the lyrics not only allude to The Patient\u2019s death appearing in the form of a Black Parade, but it also becomes an empathic anthem for the fanbase, known for its sensitivity towards topics such as depression, suicide and self-harm.\n\nWe\u2019ll carry on\nWe\u2019ll carry on\nAnd though you\u2019re dead and gone, believe me\nYour memory will carry on\nWe\u2019ll carry on\nAnd in my heart I can\u2019t contain it\nThe anthem won\u2019t explain it\n\nTrivia: the Swedish Progressive metal act Seventh Wonder have a song titled \u201cThe Black Parade\u201d, which also deals with the afterlife. That song was released in 2008.",

                    "plain": "The Black Parade is the third album by American pop punk band My Chemical Romance. The concept album follows the fictional character \u201cThe Patient\u201d through the end of his life and his death.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the Black Parade,\u201d \u201cFamous Last Words,\u201d \u201cI Don\u2019t Love You,\u201d and \u201cTeenagers\u201d were released as singles, each earning a music video.\n\nThe album received a generally positive reception, being called \u201ca rock and roll gem\u201d by Ed Thompson of IGN, and \u201cone of the most cohesive, engaging rock records of 2006\u201d by Entertainment Weekly.\n\nThe album debuted at #2 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and the U.K. Albums Chart. Over three million copies have been sold worldwide.\n\nGuitarist Ray Toro told Alternative Press:\n\nThe intention was to make something that was classic, something timeless [\u2026] we wanted to make a record you could pass down.\"\n\nThe concept behind the album seems to be a polysemous story, built upon at least two parallel paths.\nThe Patient\u2019s journey through the disease and imminent death AND the band\u2019s personal struggles (mostly lead singer Gerard\u2019s).\n\nIt is no coincidence that all the songs are featured by seemingly disconnected verses which lack the typical continuity of a plot.\nDespite being deliberately ambiguous, the almost inconclusive and delusional narration reflects the personality of The Patient that, finding himself face to face with death, is overwhelmed by conflicting emotions.\n\nThe striking example can be seen in \u201cWelcome to the Black Parade\u201d, where the lyrics not only allude to The Patient\u2019s death appearing in the form of a Black Parade, but it also becomes an empathic anthem for the fanbase, known for its sensitivity towards topics such as depression, suicide and self-harm.\n\nWe\u2019ll carry on\nWe\u2019ll carry on\nAnd though you\u2019re dead and gone, believe me\nYour memory will carry on\nWe\u2019ll carry on\nAnd in my heart I can\u2019t contain it\nThe anthem won\u2019t explain it\n\nTrivia: the Swedish Progressive metal act Seventh Wonder have a song titled \u201cThe Black Parade\u201d, which also deals with the afterlife. That song was released in 2008."
